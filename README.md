Figure 1: Natural language processing pipeline for identifying Treatment Discontinuation Topics among breast cancer twitter cohort.

## üéØObjective
Our primary objectives were threefold:
1. Develop a self-reported breast cancer tweet identification system utilizing traditional Machine learning models and RoBERTa.
2. Identify breast cancer-related concern-based topics in patients‚Äô tweets.
3. Perform sentiment intensity analysis of patients who voice dissatisfaction and identification of treatment discontinuation in the self-reported tweets category.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èTo Run the code
1. Python 3 is used as the programming language
2. Download: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/view?resourcekey=0-wjGZdNAUop6WykTtMip30g" target="_blank">GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin</a>
3. We have used Jupyter Notebook for most of the coding purposes
4. The sequence of code to run is marked by the alphabet prefix in the file name (A to E)
5. Dataset is available at request
